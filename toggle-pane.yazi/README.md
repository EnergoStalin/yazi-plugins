# toggle-pane.yazi

Toggle the show, hide, and maximize states for different panes: parent, current, and preview. It respects the user's [`ratio` settings](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/configuration/yazi#manager.ratio)!

Assume the user's `ratio` is $$[A, B, C]$$, that is, $$\text{parent}=A, \text{current}=B, \text{preview}=C$$:

- `min-parent`: Toggles between $$0$$ and $$A$$ - the parent is either completely hidden or showed with width $$A$$.
- `max-parent`: Toggles between $$A$$ and $$\infty$$ - the parent is either showed with width $$A$$ or fills the entire screen.
- `min-current`: Toggles between $$0$$ and $$B$$ - the current is either completely hidden or showed with width $$B$$.
- `max-current`: Toggles between $$B$$ and $$\infty$$ - the current is either showed with width $$B$$ or fills the entire screen.
- `min-preview`: Toggles between $$0$$ and $$C$$ - the preview is either completely hidden or showed with width $$C$$.
- `max-preview`: Toggles between $$C$$ and $$\infty$$ - the preview is either showed with width $$C$$ or fills the entire screen.
- `reset`: Resets to the user's configured `ratio`.

## Installation

```sh
ya pack -a yazi-rs/plugins:full-border
```

## Usage

Hide/Show preview:

```toml
[[manager.prepend_keymap]]
on   = "T"
run  = "plugin toggle-pane min-preview"
desc = "Show/Hide preview"
```

Maximize/Restore preview:

```toml
[[manager.prepend_keymap]]
on   = "T"
run  = "plugin toggle-pane max-preview"
desc = "Maximize/Restore preview"
```

You can replace `preview` with `current` or `parent` to toggle the other columns.

## Advanced

In addition to triggering the plugin with a keypress, you can also trigger it in your `init.lua` file:

```lua
if os.getenv("NVIM") then
	require("toggle-pane"):entry("min-preview")
end
```

In the example above, when it detects that you're [using Yazi in nvim](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/resources#vim), the preview is hidden by default â€” you can always press `T` (or any key you've bound) to show it again.
